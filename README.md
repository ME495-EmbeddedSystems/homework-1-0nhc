# ME495 Embedded Systems Homework 1
Author: Zhengxiao Han
1. Use `ros2 launch turtle_control waypoints.launch.xml` to run the code
2. The `ros2 service call /load turtle_interfaces/srv/Waypoints "{waypoints: [{x: 1.4, y: 1.6}, {x: 2.2, y: 9.4}, {x: 7.2, y: 6.1}, {x: 4.0, y: 2.6}, {x: 8.2, y: 1.5}, {x: 4.1, y: 5.3}]}"` service loads waypoints for the turtle to follow
3. The `ros2 service call /toggle std_srvs/srv/Empty "{}"` starts and stops the turtle.
4. When replaying the rosbag, the turtle moves looks like what it was before, but as time goes, the trajectory will gradually drift from the original trajectory.
5. Here is a video of the turtle in action.
